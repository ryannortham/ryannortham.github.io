I am a Senior Platform Engineer at Azenix, a company that is part of the Mantel Group house of brands. Currently living in Melbourne, Australia.

I specialise in Microsoft Azure technologies, DevOps, and Agile leadership. I have extensive experience in stakeholder engagement, requirements elicitation, backlog management, and solution design. I love to be hands-on with my work, and I am most comfortable when I am coding solutions alongside my team.
